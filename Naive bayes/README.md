We used Naïve Bayes classification because of its speed and accuracy. It works on some mathematical theory, so there is no complex training method needed. It’s a member of probabilistic classifier.<br>
Our problem was classify the water from the four features. As we know it works on probabilistic theory, so we had to summarize data for faster Gaussian Probability calculation. We created two different 2D array to store data. First array to save the only safe water training data and the second one to save unsafe water data. Then we calculated the mean and Variance using these formula. <br>
𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛,𝜇= 1𝑁Σ𝑋𝑘𝑛𝑘=1 𝑉𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒= (𝛿)2=1𝑁−1Σ(𝑋𝑘−𝜇)2𝑛𝑘=1<br>
Then we find the posterior for both of the safe and unsafe class.
